# Beliefs Network (BN)

The Bayesian Network approach is powerful and useful for predicting probabilities of random variables, such as consumption decisions of goods and services like education, chocolates, and meals. Here, you can find a way to create a probabilistic graphical model (MG) for representing knowledge about an uncertain domain, where each node corresponds to random variables, and each represents conditional probability for the corresponding random variables.

This is a powerful technique based on a Directed Acyclic Graph, useful for predicting the probability of a random variable, such as a customer's visit to a store in a service scenario. The strategy involves conversing with store managers to identify the critical variables for determining whether a client will return 'soon' to make more purchases. The probability of this random variable depends on multiple inputs we need to identify, such as the walking distance, weather, day of payment, marketing efforts, types of products, technology, average time spent in line, etc.

The success of this approach is correlated with the time spent with stakeholders in the beginning to properly map the workflows (i.e., variables) involved in decision-making, which is critical for high-quality predictions.

For instance, in this particular project, the probabilities of college plans for students can be influenced based on the information of other random variables (parent nodes), such as (i) Sex; (ii) Socio-Economic Status; (iii) Parental Encouragement, and (iv) Intelligence Quotient. Below, you can see the outline of the Bayesian Network I suggest:

The conditional probability tables obtained in each node (random variable) specify the degree of belief (probabilities) that the node will be in a particular state given the state of parent nodes.

The limitation of these models includes their inability to represent dynamic relationships. This model is primarily used for data analysis.Gor this case we look for:
